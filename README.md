# VirtualPiano
A Virtual Piano project, I struggled with resizing of diffrent screens yet learnt a lot about keyboard input.Check it out and play a bit of piano.

You will find my HTML, CSS and JavaScript files in VirtualPiano> task > src.
The task was to create a virtual Piano,by adding HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
My JavaScript code is to enable the pressed key to initiate the sound of that key and if a key is pressed which is out of bounds a message is printed to the console.
